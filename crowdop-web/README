This is a web-based dashboard for CrowdOp, which is implemented by Java Play! framework
- Java version >= 1.8
======================================

When set up java play environment,
add the following configuration to the conf/application.conf:
application.baseUrl="https://dbpcm.d1.comp.nus.edu.sg:80/"
-- in order to support https, you should have a keystore.jks (e.g., use ssh-keygen to self generate one)
https.keyStore=/path/to/keystore.jks
https.keyStorePassword=yourpassword

after these configuration, go to the root dir of your play
then, use "play -Dhttp.port=disabled -Dhttps.port=80 run" command and you can access to the baseUrl on web browser
